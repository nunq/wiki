# git repo hosting

## github
* pro: people actually find your stuff (organically) with tags, etc
* pro: the search is good, but requires login most of the time to be useful
* con?: lowkey too many features, i dont need actions and all that stuff but does no harm so idk...
* con: micro$oft
* con: proprietary, can't be self-hosted
* con: github copilot copyright debacle
* con: limited functionality without javascript enabled (at least displays the file tree)

## gitlab
* pro: can be self hosted
* pro: has all the things
* con: but is rather heavy if you dont need _all the things_ (minimum requirement is 4 cores and 4gb of ram [src](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html)
* con: doesn't work without js enabled (doesn't even display the file tree)

## other git forge platforms
* do people still use bitbucket? is that still a thing?
* codeberg
* sourcehut

i haven't really looked at any of those.

## manual git hosting
* pro: decentralization, own your stuff, etc
* con: you need to set it up. besides i make backups anyways and github even put some of it in the arctic lol. also im lazy

i like the barebones feel of cgit, but gitea looks interesting too.


cgit-pink looks promising but lets see...
