# git repo hosting

## github
* pro: gets the job done!!
* pro: people actually find your stuff (organically) with tags, etc
* pro: the search is good
* con?: lowkey too many features, i dont need actions and all that stuff but does no harm so idk...
* con: microsoft
* con: proprietary
* con: github copilot copyright debacle

## gitlab
* pro: can be self hosted
* con: doesnt work without js enabled
* con: dont like the UX. also the sidebar feels weird to use but i guess they had to do something different than github (apart from being worse lol)
* con: **still** has no rss feeds and likely will never have them

## manual git hosting
* pro: decentralization, own your stuff, etc
* con: seems unnecessary? i make backups anyways and github even put some of it in the arctic lol
* con: im lazy

i like the barebones feel of cgit, but gitea looks interesting too.

do people still use bitbucket? is that still a thing?

cgit-pink looks promising but lets see...
