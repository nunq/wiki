# wayland and pipewire

> or why i haven't switched to them yet

this is mostly just a reminder for myself

## pipewire TODOs
* pirewire doesn't automatically switch audio to a newly connected monitor using `mons`. and i couldnt figure it out quickly enough in `pavucontrol`
* pipewire doesn't seem to offer any power savings compared to pulseaudio really, at least in my testing

## wayland TODOs
* figure out middle button paste
* configure dwl or river
