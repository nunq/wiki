# machine learning book notes

types:
* supervised learning (right solutions given)
* unsupervised learning (no solutions given)
* reinforcement learning (reinforce beahviour according to feedback)

supervised learning problems:
* classification (X is a ... basend on Y)
* regression (attribute Z of X is ... based on >)

* nearest neighbour (to which Y is X most similiar)

* overfitting (model works much better on trainingdata than testdata)
* underfitting (model is too weak to reproduce even trainingdata results)

* choice of features is crucial. less might be better bc less dimensions
* good, clean training data is crucial.
