# export pocketcasts starred episodes

the pocketcasts export your data user experience was terrible when i tried it a few months ago.

this is the only way i found and it cost me 3 euros. if pocketcasts was my product i'd be embarassed.

1. buy pro (3 euros/month) :(
2. go to https://play.pocketcasts.com/starred
3. devtools > network > filter by xhr
4. look for "starred"
5. copy response data and parse
6. cancel pro

!! not all starred episodes are shown on the web, idk why !!

use this for unicode escaping: https://dencode.com/en/string/unicode-escape

after that i used google sheets for data formatting
